  enabled: true
  # The security level the interpreters will be set to on startup.
  # Can be either `Block`, `Notify` or `Allow`.
  # `Block` blocks all non-operators from using them.
  # `Notify` allows anyone to use them, but notifies the operators
  # if a non-operator user uses them.
  # `Allow` allows anyone to use them.
  # Please be aware that these values are case-sensitive.
  # Regardless of this setting, no one except bot operators will ever be
  # able to use the interpreters inside query (user-to-user, "PM") channels.

# An operator match is a set of rules that will be matched against a user
# in order to determine whether they're allowed to use operator commands.
# If any of these rules fails, the match fails.

# Possible tags are `nick`, `unique-id`, and `uid`.
# `nick` is matched against a user's nickname.
# 'unique-id' is matched against a user's unique ID.
# `uid` is matched against their User ID in the database.
# The default value for each of these rules is `*`, which matches everything,
# so be sure to specify at least some rules, unless you want everyone to have
# operator rights (you don't).
