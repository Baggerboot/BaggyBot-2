BaggyBot is an IRC bot built for collecting statistics in an IRC channel.
In addition, it provides various other features to the users.

Features
--------

His main feature is collecting statistics about each user, as well as the channel as a whole.
Nearly all IRC activity is logged to a database, which means the bot can also be used for logging IRC history.
Furthermore, specific statistics are kept about each user, such as:
 - Total amount of lines sent
 - Total amount of words sent
 - Total amount of actions (/me <action>)
 - Total amount of swears
 
In addition, statistics about individual words, emoticons, username references (pings) and URLS are stored as well; 
generally containing information about how often the word/username/emoticon/URL has been encountered,
as well as the name of the last user who said it.

Finally, BaggyBot is able to grab random quotes from users, and store these in the database as well.
